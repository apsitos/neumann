        Dear Diary: Tonight I'm sneaking off to the abandoned taffy factory to look for treasure. Also, if boys had uteruses,
        they'd be called duderuses. Your ass is grass and I'm gonna mow it. Here's a bunch of numbers. They may look random but
        they're my phone number. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some
        strong, chivalrous man would lend me his jacket, or his pants.
