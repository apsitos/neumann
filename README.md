## An app allowing Turing students and alumni to share and gather information about employers 

## As a job seeker, you can use Neumann to find where Turing alumni are working and learn about their companies

## As someone who is employed, you can tell other Turing students why your company is amazing and share information about where the hiring process

The application utilizes React, Node, Express, Knex, Sass, and auth0.  Areas we'd like to improve are adding responsiveness to the website and implementing Redux.
